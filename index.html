        <img src="week02/images/lake-malawi.jpg" alt="Lake Malawi">
        <p>Malawi is a peaceful and beautiful landlocked country in southeastern Africa, known as the "Warm Heart of
            Africa" because of the friendliness of its people. The country is famous for Lake Malawi, one of the largest
            and
            clearest freshwater lakes in the world, offering stunning beaches, diverse fish species, and vibrant
            tourism. Malawi features rolling hills, green plateaus, rich cultural traditions, wildlife parks, and a
            growing
            economy supported by agriculture, tourism, and small-scale industries. With a blend of natural beauty and
            welcoming
            communities, Malawi continues to be a unique and inspiring destination in the region.</p>
